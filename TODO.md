- Add more tests before adding more logic
- Move to jest since it has a maintained helper for all the game constants (screeps-jest)
- Rewrite MemoryBackedClass to make some semblance of sense

- Rework initial commit into an empty merge commit for a clearer starting point (maybe use an empty Initial Commit)
