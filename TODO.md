- Add more tests before adding more logic
- Rewrite MemoryBackedClass to make some semblance of sense
- Determine Tasking abstraction layer (TaskHelpers.loadConfig vs the Tasking extension controlling all memory access) - Maybe lean more on TaskHelpers with loadConfig and saveConfig called by Tasking?
- Rework initial commit into an empty merge commit for a clearer starting point (maybe use an empty Initial Commit)
